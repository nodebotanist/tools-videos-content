## *The Multimeter*

# What is a Multimeter?

* A tool that measures voltage from one point to another
* Voltage: potential difference. (Wait, what?)
* The best tool to start your arsenal

# How to use a Multimeter

1. Take the ground probe (usually black) and place it on a ground in your circuit
	1. Don't know what ground is? That's fine! Check the links below!
2. Take the [TODO: What is this called] probe (usually red) and place it on the contact to see the voltage between the probes.

## Some interesting places to test voltage between
 
 * Ground and Power on a Microcontroller
		* Unlike a regular wire, placing the 2 probes at ground and power will NOT short your micrcontroller
* Ground and the analog out of a sensor
	* See how voltage turns to data

## More interesting places to test

* Ground and a really long power wire (~3ft) (MICROCONTROLLER ONLY)
	* Do you notice a difference?
* Ground and a PWM output pin
